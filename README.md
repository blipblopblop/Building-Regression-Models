# Linear-Regression
Use scikit-learn library to implement Simple linear regression. We download a dataset that is related to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. Then, we split our data into training and test sets, create a model using training set, evaluate your model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown value. 

# Multiple Linear-Regression
Use scikit-learn library to implement Multiple linear regression. We again use the Carbon dioxide emission dataset to build a model, Evaluate the model, and finally use model to predict unknown value

# Polynomial Regression
Using Polynomial regressions to solve problems through transferring the necessary feature sets. 

# Non-linear Regression
Fit a non-linear model to the data points corresponding to China's GDP from 1960 to 2014
